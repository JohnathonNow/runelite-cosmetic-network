# Cosmetics Network
A plugin for setting up some cosmetic appearance for yourself that every other user with the plugin can see.

# Using the plugin
Once the plugin is enabled, it will query for the costumes of other players and apply them as needed.

In order to set your own cosmetics:  
1. Disable the plugin.
2. Equip whatever you want your cosmetic appearance to be.  
3. Enter the settings menu of the Cosmetics plugin.  
4. Toggle the `Save Now` option.  
5. Turn the plugin back on.  

This will save your cosmetics data and will become visible to everyone else using the plugin within five minutes.

Note that this branch is the branch for the plugin itself. The [db](https://github.com/JohnathonNow/runelite-cosmetic-network/tree/db)
branch contains the source code for the backend that stores the cosmetics of every player.
